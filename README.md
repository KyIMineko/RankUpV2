RankUpV2
========
RankUpV2 is a remake of the original RankUp Plugin by @Falkirks, @Bamuel and @Darunia18. Check out their original repo [here](https://github.com/falkirks/RankUp).
RankUp is a comically full-featured prison ranking plugin. It allows players upgrade their ranking using a certain amount of money. To manage ranks, RankUp comes with a built in group manager called DoesGroups. You can also use PurePerms to manage ranks. RankUp comes with support for both EconomyS and PocketMoney for a currency.
This was done in a hurry with minimum knowledge of PHP, since we play around in JS too much, so I'm sorry if there are any bugs or errors.

## Permissions
